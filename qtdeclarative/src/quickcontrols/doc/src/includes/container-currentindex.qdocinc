When \1 is paired with another container such as \l \2, it is
necessary to make a two-way binding between the
\l {Container::}{currentIndex} property
of each control. To do this without breaking bindings, avoid setting
\c currentIndex directly, and instead use
\l {Container::}{setCurrentIndex()}, for example.
See \l {Managing the Current Index} for more information.
